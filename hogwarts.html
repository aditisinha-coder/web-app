    <h2>Welcome to Hogwarts University!</h2>
    <p>
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a renowned institution in the wizarding world, located in Scotland. Founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards—Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin—it stands as a bastion of magical education and tradition.

        The castle itself is both majestic and mysterious, concealed from Muggle (non-magical) eyes by powerful enchantments. Its towering spires and winding corridors house not only classrooms and libraries but also secret passages, magical creatures, and enchanted objects.

        Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the name and values of its founder. Gryffindor values bravery and daring, Hufflepuff values loyalty and hard work, Ravenclaw values wisdom and intellect, and Slytherin values ambition and cunning. Students are sorted into these houses upon arrival using the magical Sorting Hat, which considers their traits and preferences.

        Throughout its long history, Hogwarts has been home to countless witches and wizards who have honed their magical abilities under the guidance of skilled professors. From Potions to Transfiguration, from Quidditch matches to the annual House Cup competition, Hogwarts offers a rich and immersive education where friendships are forged, adventures unfold, and the mysteries of the magical world are revealed.
